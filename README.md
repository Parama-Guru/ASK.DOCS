Project Title: ASK.DOCS

Description:

Developed a Streamlit-based web application that enables users to upload documents (in PDF or TXT format) and interactively ask questions based on the content of the uploaded documents. The application leverages advanced natural language processing techniques, including document embedding and a question-answering engine, to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers. Key features include real-time document processing, dynamic question handling, and automated cleanup of uploaded files.

Key Responsibilities:
	•	Designed and implemented a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit for document upload and question input.
	•	Developed backend logic for saving uploaded documents and ensuring data integrity.
	•	Integrated document processing functions to load and parse content from PDF and TXT files.
	•	Utilized state-of-the-art embedding models and a question-answering engine to handle user queries effectively.
	•	Ensured efficient resource management by implementing automatic cleanup of temporary files.
	•	Conducted thorough testing and debugging to ensure reliability and accuracy of the application.
